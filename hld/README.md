# Common concepts
Three concerns that are important in most software systems:
1. **Reliability**: Tolerating hardware and software faults and human errors. The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error)
2. **Scalability**: Measuring load and performance, latency percentiles & throughput. As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.
3. **Maintainability**: Operability, simplicity & evolvability. Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new usecases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.

### Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process, to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

### Performance

Performance is characterized by the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used. Depending on the context, this may involve achieving one or more of the following:

1. Short response time/low latency for a given piece of work
2. High throughput (rate of processing work)
3. Low utilization of computing resource(s)

### Availability

Availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be unavailable.

### Fault tolerance

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to behave in a well-defined manner once faults occur.
