# Common concepts

### Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process, to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

### Performance

Performance is characterized by the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used. Depending on the context, this may involve achieving one or more of the following:

1. Short response time/low latency for a given piece of work
2. High throughput (rate of processing work)
3. Low utilization of computing resource(s)

### Availability

Availability the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. If a user cannot access the system, it is said to be unavailable.

### Fault tolerance

Fault tolerance ability of a system to behave in a well-defined manner once faults occur.
