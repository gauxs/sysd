# Other Indexing Structures

1. Key-Value Indexes:

   - Similar to primary key indexes in relational models.
   - Uniquely identify rows, documents, or vertices.

2. Secondary Indexes:

   - Common in relational databases to optimize join operations.
   - Created using CREATE INDEX command.
   - Handles non-unique keys by either using lists of matching identifiers or appending row identifiers to keys.
   - Suitable for both B-trees and log-structured indexes.

3. Storing Values within the Index:

   - Heap File: Stores data separately, allowing multiple indexes to reference the same data location.
   - Clustered Index: Stores data directly within the index (e.g., InnoDB in MySQL). The primary key of a table is always a clustered index, and secondary indexes refer to the primary key (rather than a heap file location).
   - Covering Index: Stores some columns within the index, enabling queries to be answered by the index alone.

4. Multi-Column Indexes:

   - Concatenated Index: Combines multiple fields into one key, useful for ordered queries.
   - Multi-Dimensional Indexes: Used for complex queries (e.g., geospatial data). R-trees are common in spatial indexing (e.g., PostGIS).

5. Full-Text Search and Fuzzy Indexes:

   - Handles inexact matches, typos, and linguistic variations.
   - Lucene uses SSTable-like structures with a finite state automaton for efficient fuzzy searching.

6. In-Memory Databases:

   - Advantages: Higher performance due to avoiding disk-related overheads, potential durability with special hardware(such as battery-powered RAM) or logging.
   - Challenges: Managing data larger than available memory, potentially using an anti-caching approach(eviction strategies).
   - Examples: VoltDB, MemSQL, Oracle TimesTen, RAMCloud, Redis.

7. Future of Storage Engine Design: Consideration of non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies, though still a developing research area.
